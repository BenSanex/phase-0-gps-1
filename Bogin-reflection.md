##GPS 1 Reflection

**What git concepts were you struggling with during the GPS session?**

I didn't know certain git terms such as git fetch, and until now, wasn't aware of the difference between git commands (git status) and flags, such as -b.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The difference between git commands and git flags. The difference between fetch and pull.

**What questions did you ask your pair during your guide?**

Pair: Mostly making sure I heard right when I was driving.
Guide: How do I know if we're officially collaborators on GitHub?

**What still confuses you about git?**

I have a lot of commands to learn.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Great. My pair and I communicated well. The guide was helpful, but mostly let us figure things out. We got lost a couple times, but quickly found our way back thanks to Google.
