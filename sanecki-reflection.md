1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  
  The part I struggled with was how to see the changes in the actual file when you switch between branches.  It not as easy to see on cloud 9 as it is in other live environments, but during the GPS I was able to see it.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  
  We learned what happens if you need to roll back to a previous change, by accident.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  
  I asked my pair more about windows PowerShell, and clarification questions on how his repos were set up.
  We asked the guide about being collaborators on GitHub.  We also needed help getting out of Vim.
  
4. What still confuses you about git?

  I am still a skeptical mostly about changing branches in cloud 9, but that will be answered when we get to Phase 1.
  
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  I didn't quite know what to expect, but it went better than I hoped.  It verified a lot of things that I learned, and it wasn't stressful having someone else to code with like I was afraid of.
